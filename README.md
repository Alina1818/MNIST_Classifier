Image classification + OOP

# MNIST Classifier Project

This project implements three classification models for the MNIST dataset:
- Random Forest
- Feed-Forward Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network

## Structure
- `mnist_models.py` — model classes and training logic  
- `demo.ipynb` — demonstration of model training and evaluation  
- `requirements.txt` — list of dependencies  

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
